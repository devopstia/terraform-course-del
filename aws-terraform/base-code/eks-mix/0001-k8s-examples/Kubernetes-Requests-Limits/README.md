# Kubernetes - Requests and Limits

## Step-01: Introduction
- We can specify how much each container a pod needs the resources like CPU & Memory. 
- When we provide this information in our pod, the scheduler uses this information to decide which node to place the Pod on. 
- When you specify a resource limit for a Container, the kubelet enforces those `limits` so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource than the limit you set. 
-  The kubelet also reserves at least the `request` amount of that system resource specifically for that container to use.

## Step-02: Add Requests & Limits
```yml
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "128Mi" # 128 MebiByte is equal to 135 Megabyte (MB)
              cpu: "500m" # `m` means milliCPU
            limits:
              memory: "500Mi"
              cpu: "1000m"  # 1000m is equal to 1 VCPU core                                          
```
